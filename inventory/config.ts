      {
        question: "What is MvpFast?",
        answer: "MvpFast is a NextJS starter kit that helps you build SaaS applications, AI tools, and web apps faster with pre-built components and integrations."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the difference between MvpFast and other boilerplates?",
        answer: "MvpFast gives you a choice between two database options: Convex or Supabase. So you can choose between a real-time database or a relational database."
      },
      {question: "Which database should I choose?",
      answer: "It depends on your needs. If you need real-time data sync, go with Convex. If you need a relational database, go with Supabase. Examples of use cases: Convex is great for chat apps, e-commerce and real-time applications. Supabase is great for admin panels, CRM, and other applications that require complex relationships between data."},
      {
        question: "What's included in the boilerplate?",
        answer: "The boilerplate includes NextJS setup, SEO optimization, Stripe payments, Clerk authentication, Convex database integration, Resend emails, a component library, and more."
      },
      {
        question: "Are there any other costs?",
        answer: "No, the boilerplate is free to use. You'll only need to set up accounts for Stripe (payments), Clerk (auth) and Convex (database) when you're ready to launch. All three offer generous free tiers for startupsâ€” so you can launch your first app for $0/month."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you offer support?",
        answer: "Yes! Depending on your plan, you can get access to our Discord community and 24/7 support to help you build your application."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I get a refund?",
        answer: "After you've got access to the repo, the boilerplate is yours forever, so it can't be refunded. But rest assured, our users ship startups in 7 days on average and make their first $ online in record time."
      },
      {
        question: "How often are you updating the boilerplate?",
        answer: "I ship updates to the boilerplate often as I use it for my own projects. You can follow the progress on GitHub."
